# Tutr
Application for users to find tutors for subjects they would like to study. They can view tutors and their ratings. 

# Motivation
While visiting Bangladesh, my cousin had an idea of making a tutoring company which worked for students who were looking to learn various subjects. I wanted to start building a resource for users to find tutors that they know will be qualified for their needs. We want the application to be light weight and adhere to Google's design specifications as a majority of users have Android devices.
